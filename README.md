## Project Overview
This project was built as final submission for the capstone project issued to us in our 3 months web development training at the [Edo Innovation Hub](https://edoinnovates.com). The project was officially named "Attendly" and was built by a group of developers.

Attendly was built with the sole aim of creating an attendance management system that would be useful to both the hub and to other organisations who might need such applications. Attendly would be able to help firms and acdemies in monitoring their attendance seamlessly. This will reduce the errors common to the manual approach to this proceduce as well as the human bias attached with it.

> Attendly is temporarily hosted on Firebase at [attendly-ai.web.app](https://attendly-ai.web.app). The project is still very much in his developemnt phase but the basic plans and ideas have been formulated and the project is sure to be a well recognized platform.


## Conclusion
Attendly is spearheaded by a few developers whose names are used to create different brances on the repo. The project is in high need of experienced developers so we can take this platform to the next step. Your contributions are much appreciated.
